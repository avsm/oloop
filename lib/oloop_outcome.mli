(** Outcome of trying to evaluating a phrase. Attempting to evaluate
    an arbitrary string as an OCaml phrase can lead to a variety of
    outcomes, all of which are captured by [t]:

    - [`Eval (Ophr_eval | Ophr_signature)] - The phrase type checks,
    and the OCaml toplevel successfully evaluates it. We provide the
    semantic result as an OCaml [out_phrase], and any output that may
    have been printed to stdout/stderr.

    - [`Eval Ophr_exception] - The phrase type checks, the OCaml
    toplevel evaluates it, but an exception is raised. We provide
    information about the exception as an OCaml [out_phrase], and any
    output that may have been printed to stdout/stderr.

    - [`Uneval invalid_phrase] - The phrase contains a syntax or type
    error, preventing evaluation. We provide compiler constructs
    representing the various possible errors, and also a string with a
    human readable explanation of the error.

    - [`Uneval `Internal_error] - The phrase could not be evaluated
    because the OCaml toploop raised an exception not captured by
    the [invalid_phrase] enumeration.

(** The result of a successful evaluation of a phrase.  In particular,
    it contains the content printed out to stdout and stderr by the
    phrase.  The ['a] parameter can be one of the following phantom
    types:

    - [separate] - Indicates that stdout and stderr are captured
    separately. In this case, you lose information about the relative
    order in which content was printed to stdout vs stderr.

    - [merged] - Indicates that stderr is redirected to stdout, and
    thus you can only get the stdout. In this case, you lose
    information about whether content was printed to stdout or to
    stderr.  *)
